        <p>Here's a short funny story about myself: You couldn't have probably decode by now that I'm a chemical engineer by profession who did his graduation from one of the top reputed universities in India. And unlike most of the chemical engineer's story which is that they took this course because they used to love chemistry, I took it because I did not do well in JEE (yeah, I suck at competitive examination of every kind) and secondly I used to love mathematics so much. Originally, I had a knack for going into coding when I was in class 11 but slowly that interest died because of JEE preparation. And after getting into college, I came to believe that coding is not my thing at all. But I was wrong. Since few months, I had this sudden urge to learn coding and now I'm a full stack software developer. I've listed some of the earliest projects of mine that I did which was inspired by respected Angela Yu</p>
